### perf

- Instructions can be essentially free [if you're waiting for your memory to catch up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEG4Qyo_4Bc&feature=share). Here's [a bit of a deep dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP6NxVxDQIs) from a past CppCon. And [here's how you measure it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXaxk27zwlk&feature=youtu.be), by Chandler Carruth, one of my favourite speakers.

- This is a classic. [Why is GNU grep so fast?](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2010-August/019310.html) It does very little and it does this to as few bytes as possible. These advice apply to a much wider number of situations.

Measure everything. Really cool simple demos on perf tracking.

george tank youtube talks

- Matt Godbolt is another of my favourite speakers, here's [a talk mostly about compilers](https://youtu.be/bSkpMdDe4g4?t=2852), but also about his super popular site, [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/), how it works, what resources it needs (it seems ridiculously efficient), how it does isolation, security etc.

title: Geohash in Golang Assembly: Lessons in absurd optimization:

https://mmcloughlin.com/posts/geohash-assembly

------------------------

- Writing assembly is tough, I'd never go that road. But I've just found out that even people proficient in assembly use tooling that helps build it. There's a Python tool and a Go tool, [here's a good introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y5CZ7_tyA4&feature=share). The speaker also has a fun post about [absurd optimisations](https://mmcloughlin.com/posts/geohash-assembly).

title: simdjson

Dan @lemire's talk on the internals of simdjson from last year's QCon is finally on YouTube.

It's a well paced talk, I really liked the simd tricks for integer parsing and the nibble stuff for tokenisation.

### languages

#### rust

Rustaceans tend to be quite... enthusiastic, but this is a good, somber [overview of borrower and mutex primitives](https://youtu.be/s19G6n0UjsM).



------------------------

title: Initial reactions to Rust

Bryan Cantrill got me hooked (link?)
  He r commends learning the language, not writing code, might be a food idea

Better std::collections
i128
generics (they require tooling for quality intellisense, vs code is failing me)
better optimisation (llvm)
similarly bad ecosystem as go
generally better performant libraries (csv)
interesting error handling
better than go: iterators <3 hashsets <3

march native

the compiler is very helpful in telling you what you did wrong (of which you'll do a lot)
it moves way too fast for my liking - much faster than go

the docs are quite elaborate, but also confusing (e.g. the function signatures)

hashmap.entry(line.clone()).or_insert(1);
   SOO NICE, just like python

accumulators etc.

mutable strings - in go I have zero control over allocations when creating 

strings (they are omitted in some map accesses though)

Incl str!!!

BUUUUT, it's super complex and moves fast

Interesting design dexision in Rust, not just from a language theory perspective, but more about user usage. Also talks about language governance and its evolution. 

------------------------

Bryan Cantrill tends to get excited about stuff. Here he [talks about various languages](https://youtu.be/HgtRAbE1nBM) and why he likes Rust. Oh and [here as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wZ1pCpJUIM). I also enjoyed his talk on [growing teams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KeYzjILqDo).

Rustaceans tend to be quite... enthusiastic, but this is a good, somber [overview of borrower and mutex primitives](https://youtu.be/s19G6n0UjsM).

#### C/C++
I've only written tiny bits of C++ and I was quite surprised how it differs from the C/C++ code I saw years and years ago. And here's [Kate Gregory talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk&feature=share) about how modern C++ should be taught as exactly that, modern C++.

------------------------

#### Python


Python wheels are still magic to me, but they are a tiny bit less magic now, [thanks to this PyCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02aAZ8u3wEQ&feature=share).


There's a walrus operator coming in Python 3.8. Do you not know? [Here's not only what it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uAvHOKofws&feature=share), but also a reminder that we should be nice to other people on the internet, and what's changing in terms of Python governance.



I teach Python and I often struggle when explaining decorators, [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjHpMCIvwsY&feature=share) is a great overview of not just what they are, but also *why* they work.

‪I knew that CPython can efficiently concatenate strings, despite their immutability. I never knew why, thanks for this explanation. https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2019/11/string-concat.html‬

------------------------


- Raymond Hettinger is a core Python developer, he's quite known for being a great speaker and educator. Here's [a talk on Python dictionaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33CVV29OG8), how they came up to be, how their implementation changed over the years and what it means for their users.

#### Go

------------------------

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NKQX-TdNMc&feature=share

It’s a bit annoying that Go can’t mock, so you have to do all this interface kungfu. But at least it’s more explicit.

title: go inlining

comment for: https://lemire.me/blog/2020/06/04/the-go-compiler-needs-to-be-smarter/

A frustrating thing about inlining in Go is that there's a fairly arbitrary cost model and you sometimes end up fighting it (lookup George Tankersley's talks on YouTube). There have been tons of discussions about whether or not it should be user configurable, if inlining hints should happen at the call sites or function definitions etc.
It's quite a nice discussion that helps people understand the toolchain. It also goes to show that while a self hosted build system is nice, you forgo decades of gcc/llvm optimisations. https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17566

------------------------

#### javascript

- A great talk by the creator of Node.js. [What he regrets and what he’d do differently.](https://youtu.be/M3BM9TB-8yA)


#### webassembly

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtjoaTfbdcA&feature=share

------------------------

title: webassembly beyond the web

I've been following the developments of WebAssembly a bit over the past few years, but I haven't seen such a convincing and clear explanation as to why it's a big deal. This is a great presentation in terms of clarity, content, and form. Thanks, @callahad. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGo3vJVTlyQ

------------------------

### internals

#### algorithms

------------------------

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zpHdh70Xdk&feature=share

Averaging is not as easy as i thought

------------------------


4. MapReduce - one of the most influential data engineering papers in the past two decades - it directly lead to data processing in Hadoop and later to Spark, both of which leverage these ideas of horizonally scaling computation on a bunch of nodes in a fault tolerant way. https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf


#### architecture

- I love to listen to data architecture descriptions and I love it ever more when the bottom line is: we just use Postgres (usually heavily partitioned). There are a few podcast episodes on these, there's [Outlier](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/29/data-engineering-automation-with-mike-kim/), [Pex](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/22/video-search-with-rasty-turek/) or [Heap](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/heap-with-dan-robinson-episode-36/).


1. Firecracker - isolation is not just about Docker, because security and performance are two major areas of research in container isolation. Firecracker is an OSS offering from Amazon, which they already use in Lambda and the main ruse is that it allows for extremely low latency and low utilisation of resources. https://www.amazon.science/publications/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-applications

The Amazon Builders’ Library is a nice resource, I hope they add more content over time. Here’s a bit of it in video form (I liked the shuffle sharding explanation).

It has text form, but I only watched this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKRdemSirDM&feature=emb_logo

---

It's not all just about velocity, features and such, it's also about good design. [Here's a Google talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSAYlu0NcY&feature=share) by John Ousterhout about that very topic. He also [has a new book about that](https://twitter.com/johnousterhout/status/989260683836506112?lang=en), it's on my todo list.

Never knew this whole area even existed as a thing


#### data structures

- There are tons of interesting data structures and algorithms, Nicholas Ormrod covers a few of them in [this great CppCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA-nB2wjVcI). I highly recommend the last part where he talks about [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog), an algorithm which is very close to magic. Oh and I also gave a talk on HyperLogLog and similar algorithms at [this year's PyData Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ean3Bx_o_M).

title: Cuckoo

‪Being a big fan of Bloom filters, I really enjoyed this paper on Cuckoo filters. They are better in many ways, one only has to be careful about insertion performance at high occupancy. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-conext2014.pdf‬

------------------------

- I dislike all things Java/JVM, but I'm always astonished at Elasticsearch's performance. [In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ-rXP-D80U&feature=share), Adrien Grand describes at length what sort of data structures and algorithms are used in Elasticsearch and Lucene.


title: CRDT

This short talk on CRDTs is not only good in terms of explaining the basics of conflict free data structures, but the speaker also highlights good UX in data applications, something that is grossly overlooked. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEcwa68f-jY

title: How locks work

And how to avoid their performance penalties. A great talk by Kavya.

#### time

- UTC, just use UTC. [Turns out, it's not quite a universal advice as it might seem.](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2019/03/27/storing-utc-is-not-a-silver-bullet/)

------------------------

#### parallelism

------------------------

Lots of parallel primitives in Python, this is a great oberview https://youtu.be/0RaotdCa_j0

------------------------

5. Raft - how does one achieve consensus across a distributed system? Where do we keep the truth and how do we handle failures? Paxos used to be the answer, but it's a notoriously hard problem and this implementation was quite difficult to work with. Raft is a newer and simpler solution to this coordination problem and it's widely used in distributed systems. https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf

------------------------

#### software development

------------------------

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PorfLSr3DDI&feature=share

------------------------


- Code reviews are essential, but that doesn't mean we have to do PEP8 and other code quality checks by hand. [Automate these away as much as possible.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1lDk_WKXvY)
- Dependency management is hard. Here are [a few notes from the creator of pipenv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBQAKldqgZs). I'm still not entirely sold on pipenv, but I do tend to use it, because it's nicely built into our deployment flow.

https://medium.com/@mattklein123/crash-early-and-crash-often-for-more-reliable-software-597738dd21c5

Sont do try except pass

------------------------

- I expected a dry talk on code reviews and it ended up being [a really nice overview of culture, soft skills, helping newcomers, dealing with anxiety, GTD etc](https://youtu.be/iNG1a--SIlk).
- Forget PEP8, version control, reviews or tests. No bash, subprocess run all the things, just good old sloppy code that *solves your problem*. [Super fast and excellent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd8ulMb6_ls).


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYucYon2-lk&feature=share

------------------------

title: TDD where did it go wrong

- TDD has become almost a religion. Here's a great talk on [where it all went wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM). Ian Cooper covers the origins - like red-green-refactor - but also the bad practices we've come to adopt, the most prominent one being that we tend to test implementations rather than behaviour. Once you factor in your implementation details into your test, you've deviated from the original idea of TDD.

------------------------


- I can highly recommend all of Kyle Kingsbury's talks. He built this testing suite, Jepsen, which verifies data stores and checks them for consistency guarantees, data loss, split brain, dirty reads, ... Oh and [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRc0O9VgzB0) includes zings like “Turns out the write ahead log wasn’t write ahead.” If you're not fluent in this terminology, I can highly recommend [Martin Kleppmann's book](http://dataintensive.net/).

### legacy software

- With Python 2 about to be deprecated, there are a few talks about migration to Python 3. There's Facebook's take [from PyCon 2018](https://youtu.be/H4SS9yVWJYA) and Instagram's [from PyCon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66XoCk79kjM). Oh and the most recent now - how [Pinterest did the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1vqfBEAkNA&feature=share) - it's a bit more about the code differences rather than how they actually migrated.

title: map reduce paper

the map reduce paper is super easy to read and there are tons of things I like about it
- it's driven by a real need (compute a lot of stuff)
- it uses commodity hardware, which later enabled thousands of developers worldwide to leverage the methodology
- they describe a system of backup tasks that fix the issue of outliers taking ages to complete
- they focus on the fact that the system allows for a much simplified computing model - people without the knowledge of distributed computing can write massively paralelised workloads - in a way it's similar to SQL

https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf

------------------------

Networks are problematic. Ever since reading Designing Data Intensive Applications, I’ve been more aware of this. This article, co-authored by Kyle Kingsbury of Jepsen, describes a whole host of network issues. https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2639988.2655736

------------------------


3. Kafka - message queues have a looong tradition in computer science, but they are usually thought of as ephemeral - messages come, get processed and get discarded. Kafka was the first major system where storing messages and replays were accounted for in its design. It created a whole new area of data processing, where the stream plays a more important role than storage (=database), because you can always recreate the latter from the former, but not vice versa. http://notes.stephenholiday.com/Kafka.pdf

A super impressive live demo

- One of the most cited issues with pandas has been its inability to contain integer series with nulls. This lack of support is caused by the treatment of nulls in series - pandas uses sentinel values rather than a separate bitarray. Here is [a good overview of what's changed recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxvTVxlvH9w) by Jeff Reback, pandas' long time maintainer.

title: pandas pipelines

Ondrej Kokes:palm_tree: 4:51 PM
It’s really painful to be working with Jupyter notebooks with hundreds of cells. Here’s a really really nice overview of pandas+Jupyter pipelines that allow you to create reproducible and easy to maintain pipelines with logging, all for the sake of maintainability. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXGCKqo5cEY

Ondrej Kokes:palm_tree:  13 minutes ago
Much of the content is taken from these Modern Pandas tutorials, I can highly recommend them as supplementary reading. https://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-1-intro.html

#### spark

- If you working with Spark, chances are you've read something from Jacek Laskowski, he maintains [a few sites on the internals of Spark or Kafka](https://github.com/jaceklaskowski), these are really good resources relating to underdocumented pieces of code. One fairly recent addition to Spark is bucketing and Jacek [had a nice Spark Summit talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv7IIYuQOXI) on the topic.



------------------------

title: Initial thoughts on Spark

scales better than pandas, that's great
api changes dramatically and fast - hard to adapt
learning scala is painful - seems like learning lua for torch - luckily PySpark is very good and outside rdd, the performance is great
lazy evaluation is fine, but it's hard to debug
locally, it's much slower
predicate pushdown is fantastic, but drill has that too
stack traces by default? I want normal logging
single-node setup is a breeze, unlike presto and other big data solutions
 too many ways you can do stuff - select a dataframe column in eight different ways

------------------------

spark cannot write to s3 in v4 only regions
    also, it cannot use aws by default

                .config('fs.s3a.endpoint', 's3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com')

Interesting things coming to postgres 12, further partitioning improvements, better JSON support, but mainly some internal changes that allow for pluggable storage, which is likely to be user-facing in pg13 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMLl-t4H_KI

------------------------

I’m a sucker for database internals talks. Here’s a very clear talk about InfluxDB - memory layout, on disk serialisation, compression, hashing.

title: dynamo paper

The legendary Dynamo paper turns out to be a very dense piece of writing. Took me quite a while to parse it all, let alone understand at least some of it. https://allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf

There are a number of techniques they employ. I like the symmetric nodes thing, which allows for simpler scaling. Also, partitioning based on consistent hashing results in less network traffic when clusters resize.

Tunable performance, availability and durability is a great thing that I'd welcome elsewhere - when I know I don't need consistency or integrity, let me write loads quickly, please. Kafka works sort of similar, since you can tune replication properties to change performance.

I always thought the client library was just issuing API calls, but it turns out that in Dynamo, they not only do some conflict resolution, but also pull cluster topology to avoid relying on a load balancer, which leads to better latency.

Last but not least - Dynamo is not just about DynamoDB, but about a set of principles to build distributed key-value stores. So it applies more broadly.

Overall it's a good read, but it is fairly technical.

- Postgres is my goto database and even after more than 20 years of development, there are new features introduced every year. The latest version, 11, is mostly focused around better partitioning and parallelisation. I liked two videos on it - Magnus Hagander [mostly focuses on features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgzXuFQ0Pbk), while Joe Conway [covers how development is done as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPhs-wdrb58).

title: Taking DuckDB for a spin

https://uwekorn.com/2019/10/19/taking-duckdb-for-a-spin.html

------------------------

1. Dynamo paper - one that defined a hugely scalable key-value store, it talks about the topology of the system, how it achieves its level of consistency, scale etc. http://courses.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/csce438/readings/dynamo-paper.pdf
2. Bigtable - one of the first "NewSQL" systems - hugely scalable relational systems, usually of denormalised tables and using SQL. Since horizontal scale has been a long-standing issue with classical RDBMS, these NewSQL systems try to forgo some of the guarantees of RDBMS (e.g. foreign keys or transaction), but offer much better scale. https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf


6. Spanner - this scalable database by Google has one specific feature - it not only scales, but it does so while not sacrificing as much as Bigtable - it allows for transactions and other synchronisation principles, which are hard to implement in a distributed system. It does so using special kinds of clocks to keep time across geographies (it even uses GPS and other hardware help). It's amazing how you can keep track of time in these hugely unreliable systems and I can recommend one more talk on this topic (by Kavya Joshi, just search on youtube for her name + "clocks"). https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf

title: Advanced SQL - window frames – Michał Konarski

https://mjk.space/advances-sql-window-frames/

------------------------

When we talk about testing, I usually think of unit tests, maybe some basic integration testing. FoundationDB's Will Wilson talks about [deterministic testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fFDFbi3toc&feature=youtu.be) and it's quite an astonishing display of effort one needs to go through to thoroughly and reliably test a complex distributed system like FoundationDB. Oh and they don't stop at software!

DynamoDB is amongst the better known NoSQL offerings, but being proprietary, we don't usually get to find out a lot about their architecture. Here, apart from [the Dynamo paper](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf), there's a nice architectural overview [from last year's AWS re:Invent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvBR71D0nAQ&feature=share).

I'm a big fan of tiered storage since, as the paper reiterates, blob storage is very cheap and extremely durable, it doesn't have the characteristics of a local disk, let alone memory, so they try to make use of each of the three for what they are meant to be used.

There are tons more things in the paper, be it scaling up and down, caring about utilisation of various resources, how consistent hashing works in situations of changing the number of nodes etc. etc.

- Learned indexes sound a bit like magic. Instead of being explicitly set up like regular indexes, these are inferred from data and can perform better. But it's better explain by one of the authors, [Tim Kraska](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkIHC7xMSRQ) or perhaps [by Robert Rodgers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q9mxMekBeE).

- You don't have to have fancy math across all your slides, I much prefer clear talks with good examples. [Robert Rodger's talk on text summarisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ5BEKVxy9k) is just that. I actually saw this one live, it was great.

> Five years ago, if you gave a computer a pile of photos, it couldn’t do much more than sort them by size. A ten year old could sort them into men and women, a fifteen year old into cool and uncool and an intern could say ‘this one’s really interesting’. Today, with ML, the computer will match the ten year old and perhaps the fifteen year old. It might never get to the intern. But what would you do if you had a million fifteen year olds to look at your data? What calls would you listen to, what images would you look at, and what file transfers or credit card payments would you inspect?

> That is, machine learning doesn't have to match experts or decades of experience or judgement. We’re not automating experts. Rather, we’re asking ‘listen to all the phone calls and find the angry ones’. ‘Read all the emails and find the anxious ones’. ‘Look at a hundred thousand photos and find the cool (or at least weird) people’.

I tend to think of the electronic world as purely digital, so it was rather refreshing to listen to [this podcast episode](https://hanselminutes.com/652/analog-computing-and-the-computer-of-the-tides-with-charles-petzold) on analog computers. Hanselminutes in general covers these fringe-sounding topics, I love it.

> Five years ago, if you gave a computer a pile of photos, it couldn’t do much more than sort them by size. A ten year old could sort them into men and women, a fifteen year old into cool and uncool and an intern could say ‘this one’s really interesting’. Today, with ML, the computer will match the ten year old and perhaps the fifteen year old. It might never get to the intern. But what would you do if you had a million fifteen year olds to look at your data? What calls would you listen to, what images would you look at, and what file transfers or credit card payments would you inspect?

> That is, machine learning doesn't have to match experts or decades of experience or judgement. We’re not automating experts. Rather, we’re asking ‘listen to all the phone calls and find the angry ones’. ‘Read all the emails and find the anxious ones’. ‘Look at a hundred thousand photos and find the cool (or at least weird) people’. 


Bryan Cantrill tends to get excited about stuff. Here he [talks about various languages](https://youtu.be/HgtRAbE1nBM) and why he likes Rust. Oh and [here as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wZ1pCpJUIM). I also enjoyed his talk on [growing teams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KeYzjILqDo).

DynamoDB is amongst the better known NoSQL offerings, but being proprietary, we don't usually get to find out a lot about their architecture. Here, apart from [the Dynamo paper](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf), there's a nice architectural overview [from last year's AWS re:Invent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvBR71D0nAQ&feature=share).

Accessibility is rather important and it doesn't take a PhD to do at least some things right. Here's a nice overview of some of the practices that make websites easier to browse by all.

This is a pretty nice tool for presenting POCs to non-technical users, in many ways similar to Voila (there’s a comparison near the end of the video). I especially like the embedding feature that leads to a serverless deployment. https://youtu.be/Ohr29FJjBi0

- hash-based file store has one more disadvantage - no sequential scans or range queries, because keys are random
- hide jupyter visibility (block incoming 8888 from outer internets) for more security - against port scanning
- apache drill - ansi sql, can be embedded, has a clean UI, has jdbc, schema on read... what's not to love?
